# Gemini Project: World Travel Planner

## Directory Overview

This directory is a personal travel planner for organizing a round-the-world trip. It uses Markdown files to document and track all aspects of the journey, from high-level strategic planning for different continents to detailed itineraries for each destination.

## Key Files & Structure

The project is organized into two main sections:

*   **`global_plan/`**: This directory contains the master plan for the entire trip, broken down by region.
    *   `North_America_trip_overview.md`: Outlines the route, timeline, and budget for the North American leg of the trip.
    *   `Northeast_Asia_trip_overview.md`: Outlines the route, timeline, and budget for the Northeast Asian leg of the trip.
    *   `Oceania_trip_overview.md`: Outlines the route, timeline, and budget for the Oceanian leg of the trip.
    *   `1_pre_trip_checklist.md`: A comprehensive checklist for pre-departure preparations (passports, insurance, vaccinations, etc.).
    *   `2_global_visas.md`: Tracks visa requirements and application statuses for all countries.

*   **`destinations/`**: This directory holds individual, detailed plans for each stop on the trip. Each destination has its own sub-directory (e.g., `Japan/`, `Italy/`) containing:
    *   `README.md`: An overview of the destination.
    *   `1_itinerary.md`: A detailed day-by-day itinerary.
    *   `2_transportation.md`: Information on flights, local transport, etc.
    *   `3_attractions.md`: Notes on sights and activities.
    *   `4_lodging_food.md`: Plans for accommodation and dining.
    *   `5_budget.md`: A specific budget for that destination.
    *   `6_visa_legal.md`: Destination-specific visa and legal information.
    *   `7_driving_rental.md`: Details on driving licenses and car rentals.
    *   `8_notes.md`: Miscellaneous notes and tips.
    *   And other country-specific markdown files.

*   **`README.md`**: The main project README, written in Chinese, explaining the structure and also containing high-level overviews of the trip.
